## Project S.I. – Docs-as-Code Portfolio Demo

Project S.I. (Search Infrastructure) is a fictional documentation suite created as a solo portfolio project to demonstrate Docs-as-Code workflows, API-style content structure, and developer-facing documentation strategies.

This project simulates a real-world Enterprise Search platform with modular, Markdown-authored documentation covering three core features:

Product Compatibility – User driven results based on products and existing limitations

Product Display – Result rendering

Product Sorting – Custom sort logic, API-driven ordering

All content was developed to serve a mixed audience of developers, IT professionals, and non-technical stakeholders—mirroring typical enterprise SaaS documentation environments.

## What This Project Demonstrates

Markdown-first documentation written and structured by hand

Git-based version control (no automation tools used)

Modular files simulating real product documentation flow

Developer-oriented clarity (e.g., API call descriptions, JSON examples)

Use of headings, consistent formatting, and scalable content architecture

## Tools & Workflow

Markdown (primary authoring language)

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration simulation

Visual Studio Code for editing and preview

Manual folder structure and IA modeled after internal Confluence-to-Git migration scenarios

## Purpose of This Project

Project S.I. was built to:

Showcase content design principles for structured, developer-friendly documentation

Reinforce Markdown fluency and Git familiarity

Demonstrate initiative in transitioning from traditional documentation systems (e.g., Confluence) to modern Docs-as-Code environments
